# Weatherapp
Angular Weather App with Rapid API from RapidApi.com to get live weather forecast values.. We will also use Angular forms to get user inputs where the user will type in the city name in our Angular weather app and then based on the city name, we will fetch the weather data for the city from the weather API.
